            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Bolankian</strong>, known natively as <em>Bôulangüneşko</em>, is the dominant language and lingua franca of the island nation of 
                <strong>Bolangadesh</strong> (<em>Bôulangüneş</em>). The language was first recorded and extensively studied 
                by a team of linguists from the <strong>Turkic World Exploration Federation</strong> in <strong>1978 CE</strong>, during an 
                expedition across the remote southern waters of the Okyanus Continent.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Bolangadesh</strong> lies deep within the central expanse of the <strong>Okyanus Sea</strong>, surrounded by violent tides and 
                dense fog banks that have kept it hidden from contact for centuries. Due to this isolation, <strong>Bolankian</strong> bears almost 
                no resemblance to the languages of neighboring continents. Its syntax and morphology are considered highly 
                agglutinative, with words often formed by stacking multiple particles to refine meaning or emotional tone.
            </p>
            <p>
                Linguists classify <strong>Bolankian</strong> as part of the <strong>Bolangic language family</strong>, a small branch of tongues
                believed to have descended and diverged from <em>Proto-Bolankian</em>. Its closest relative is
                <strong>Cebanic</strong>, spoken on the nearby island of <strong>Cebau</strong>. Although they share a distant
                origin, the two languages have evolved separately for over a millennium, resulting in significant differences in
                vocabulary, pronunciation, and grammar.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Bolankian language doesn't have an indigenous writing system and was originally a purely spoken language.
                When members of the TWEF first arrived at Bolangadesh, they required a practical way to record the language for study.
                They ultimately adopted a variation of the Turkish alphabet, both because it was familiar to them and because Bolangadesh shared several phonetic similarities with Turkish.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, Bolankian remains the official and cultural language of <strong>Bolangadesh</strong> and the <strong>Bolankian Islands</strong>.

            <h2>The Basics</h2>

            <section>
                <h3>Sentence Order</h3>
                <p>
                    Bolankian does not follow a strict sentence order because of its agglutinative system having case markers, 
                    but the most common and preferred order is Subject–Object–Verb (SOV).
                    The one rule in Bolankian sentence structure is that the tense/aspect/mood marker always comes at the end of the sentence.
                </p>

                <h3>Case Markers</h3>
                <p>
                    Like I've said before, Bolankian is a highly agglutinative language. One of the most important aspects of this 
                    is the use of case markers. Case markers are suffixes that are added to the end of nouns to indicate their grammatical 
                    role in a sentence.
                </p>
                <p>The most common cases and case markers in Bolankian are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Nominative (subject): no marker</li>
                    <li>Accusative (direct object): -leut / -eut</li>
                    <li>Dative (indirect object): -on / -en / -ğon / -ğen / -n</li>
                    <li>Genitive (possession): -nın / -onan / -nin / -ünin</li>
                    <li>Locative (location): -da / -de / -şa / -şe / -ça / -çe</li>
                    <li>Ablative (movement away from): -dan / -den / -şan / -şen / -çan / -çen</li>
                    <li>Instrumental (means by which action is performed): -le / -e / -yla / -ye / -la / -a</li>
                </ol>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Agreement</h3>
                <p>
                    In Bolankian, verbs must agree with their subjects in both number and person. This is achieved through the use of 
                    verb endings that correspond to the subject's characteristics. Agreement also depends on negation: 
                    if the subject is negated (such as "no one" or "nothing"), the verb also has to be negated. 
                    Verbs and their subjects should also follow the same vowel harmony. 
                    Adjectives do not need to agree with the nouns they modify.
                </p>
