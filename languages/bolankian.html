                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Bolankian</strong>, known natively as <em>Bôulangüneşko</em>, is the dominant language and lingua franca of the island nation of 
                    <strong>Bolangadesh</strong> (<em>Bôulangüneş</em>). The language was first recorded and systematically studied 
                    by linguists from the <strong>Turkic World Exploration Federation</strong> in <strong>1978 CE</strong>, during an 
                    expedition across the remote southern waters of the Okyanus Continent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Bolangadesh</strong> lies deep within the central expanse of the <strong>Okyanus Sea</strong>, surrounded by violent tides and 
                    dense fog banks that kept it hidden from contact for centuries. Due to this long isolation, <strong>Bolankian</strong> bears almost 
                    no resemblance to the languages of nearby continents. Its syntax and morphology are highly 
                    agglutinative, with words formed through the stacking of multiple particles to refine meaning and emotional tone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Linguists classify <strong>Bolankian</strong> as part of the <strong>Bolangic language family</strong>, a small branch of tongues
                    believed to have diverged from a common ancestor, <em>Proto-Bolankian</em>. Its closest known relative is
                    <strong>Cebanic</strong>, spoken on the neighboring island of <strong>Cebau</strong>. Although the two share a distant
                    origin, they have evolved independently for over a millennium, resulting in major differences in
                    vocabulary, phonology, and grammatical structure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bolankian originally lacked an indigenous writing system and was purely oral. When members of the TWEF first arrived in Bolangadesh,
                    they required a practical way to document the language for research. They adopted a modified version of the Turkish alphabet,
                    both due to familiarity and because of notable phonetic parallels between the two languages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, Bolankian serves as the official and cultural language of <strong>Bolangadesh</strong> and the surrounding <strong>Bolankian Islands</strong>.

                    <h3>Sentence Order</h3>
                    <p>
                        Bolankian does not follow a rigid sentence order because its case system clearly marks grammatical roles. 
                        However, the most common and natural order is Subject–Object–Verb (SOV).
                        The only strict rule in Bolankian sentence structure is that tense, aspect, and mood markers must always appear at the end of the sentence.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Case Markers</h3>
                    <p>
                        As an agglutinative language, Bolankian expresses grammatical relationships through the use of <strong>case markers</strong>—
                        suffixes attached to nouns to indicate their syntactic roles.
                    </p>
                    <p>The primary cases in Bolankian are:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Nominative</strong> (subject): no marker</li>
                        <li><strong>Accusative</strong> (direct object): <code>-leut / -eut</code></li>
                        <li><strong>Dative</strong> (indirect object): <code>-on / -en / -ğon / -ğen / -n</code></li>
                        <li><strong>Genitive</strong> (possession): <code>-nın / -onan / -nin / -ünin</code></li>
                        <li><strong>Locative</strong> (location): <code>-da / -de / -şa / -şe / -ça / -çe</code></li>
                        <li><strong>Ablative</strong> (movement away): <code>-dan / -den / -şan / -şen / -çan / -çen</code></li>
                        <li><strong>Instrumental</strong> (means): <code>-le / -e / -yla / -ye / -la / -a</code></li>
                    </ol>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Agreement</h3>
                    <p>
                        In Bolankian, verbs must agree with their subjects in both number and person, expressed through specific 
                        verb endings. Agreement also interacts with negation: if the subject is negated (e.g., “no one” or “nothing”), 
                        the verb must also appear in its negative form. Verbs and subjects should follow the same vowel harmony rules.
                        Adjectives, however, do not change to agree with the nouns they modify.
                    </p>
