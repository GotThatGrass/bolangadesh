                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Bolankian</strong>, known natively as <em>Bôulangüneşko</em>, is the dominant language of the island nation of 
                    <strong>Bolangadesh</strong> (<em>Bôulangüneş</em>). The language was first recorded and extensively studied 
                    by a team of linguists from the <strong>Turkic World Exploration Federation</strong> in <strong>1978 CE</strong>, during an 
                    expedition across the remote southern waters of the Okyanus Continent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Bolangadesh</strong> lies deep within the central expanse of the <strong>Okyanus Sea</strong>, surrounded by violent tides and 
                    dense fog banks that have kept it hidden from contact for centuries. Due to this isolation, <strong>Bolankian</strong> bears almost 
                    no resemblance to the languages of neighboring continents. Its syntax and morphology are considered highly 
                    agglutinative, with words often formed by stacking multiple particles to refine meaning or emotional tone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Linguists classify <strong>Bolankian</strong> as part of the <strong>Bolangic language family</strong>, a small branch of tongues
                    believed to have descended and diverged from <em>Proto-Bolankian</em>. Its closest relative is
                    <strong>Cebanic</strong>, spoken on the nearby island of <strong>Cebau</strong>. Although they share a distant
                    origin, the two languages have evolved separately for over a millennium, resulting in significant differences in
                    vocabulary, pronunciation, and grammar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, Bolankian remains the official and cultural language of <strong>Bolangadesh</strong> and the <strong>Bolankian Islands</strong>.

                <h2>Alphabet and Pronunciation</h2>
                <p>
                    The Bolankian language doesn't have an indigenous writing system and was originally a purely spoken language.
                    It consists of 48 sounds, including 19 core vowels and 29 consonants, though regional dialects may vary. When members of the TWEF first arrived at Bolangadesh, 
                    they required a practical way to record the language for study.
                    They ultimately adopted the Turkish alphabet, both because it was familiar to them, and because Bolangadesh shared several phonetic similarities with Turkish.

                <h3>Vowels</h3>
                <p>
                    Bolankian has 19 vowel sounds, represented with a mix of single letters, digraphs, and diacritics.
